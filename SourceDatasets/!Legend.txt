This website has a collection of waste datasets that I can use: 
https://github.com/AgaMiko/waste-datasets-review

For now I'm going to avoid the datasets which include pictures of underwater trash, since that is an unlikely use case for the eventual app I had in mind, and I don't want to mess up the training with unnecessary data.

This dataset might be good but right now I can't figure out how to pull out the category data.
Additionally, this guy has already implemented a model for identifying trash, so maybe I could yoink and just make an app out of it instead of making my project about the model itself.

Super happy to find this, really easy to use since the images are named based on their category, why doesn't everybody do this?

Well categorized, but need to submit a form to gain access, and no commercial use allowed.

Will take a little bit of effort to categorize, but I like the diversity.

Huge database but to get the images I need to make a vm and mess with some stuff that I don't feel like doing right now.

Not sure if I will be able to use it, good pictures but I don't know how they're categorized, also I feel like the pictures would all need to be cropped as Well

Only keeping this entry so I can shit on this dataset, can't believe they want to charge money for this. All a program trained on this would tell you is if an image is completely full of garbage or not.

Promising, but many of the backgrounds are static, I don't know how that affects model performance vs training images with variable backgrounds.
